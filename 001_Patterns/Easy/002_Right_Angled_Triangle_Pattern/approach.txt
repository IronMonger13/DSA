Intuition:
A right-angled triangle pattern grows row by row.
The first row contains one star, the second row contains two stars, and in general,
the i-th row contains i stars.

Why brute force fails:
There is no shortcut to avoid printing the stars.
Since the total number of stars printed is 1 + 2 + ... + n, every character must be output.
This enforces the time complexity regardless of the implementation.

Approach:
Run a loop from 1 to N.
In each iteration, print a string of '*' repeated i times to form the current row.

Time Complexity:
O(n^2) since the total number of printed characters grows on the order of n².

Space Complexity:
O(1) since no additinal data structure was used

Edge Cases:
n = 0 - nothing is printed

What I’d say in an interview:
Each row contains as many stars as its row number.
By looping from 1 to N and printing i stars per row, we directly construct the pattern.
The time complexity is unavoidable because all stars must be printed.
