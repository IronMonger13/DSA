Intuition:
The pattern consists of N rows.
In the i-th row, numbers are printed sequentially from 1 up to i.
Each row therefore grows by one number compared to the previous row.

Why brute force fails:
There is no way to avoid printing every number in the pattern.
Since the total count of printed numbers grows as 1 + 2 + ... + N,
the required work is inherent to the output itself.

Approach:
Run an outer loop from 1 to N to control the rows.
For each row i, run an inner loop from 1 to i and print the numbers sequentially.
Print a newline after completing each row.

Time Complexity:
O(n^2) since the total number of printed values grows on the order of n^2.

Space Complexity:
O(1) since no additional data structures were used

Edge Cases:
n = 0 - nothing is printed

What I’d say in an interview:
Each row prints numbers from 1 up to its row index.
By nesting a loop that runs up to the current row inside a loop from 1 to N,
we can directly generate the required number pyramid.
The time complexity is unavoidable because all numbers must be printed.
