Intuition:
A rectangular star pattern consists of N rows, where each row contains exactly N stars.
So the problem reduces to printing one row of N stars, N times.

Why brute force fails:
There is no simpler brute force alternative here since every star must be printed.
Any solution must output N × N characters, which already enforces O(n²) time.

Approach:
Use a loop that runs N times for the rows.
In each iteration, print N stars in a single line.

Time Complexity:
O(n²) — because N rows are printed and each row contains N stars.

Space Complexity:
O(1) — no extra data structures are used; output space is not counted.

Edge Cases:
- N = 0 → nothing is printed
- N = 1 → a single star is printed

What I’d say in an interview:
Since every star must be printed, the time complexity cannot be better than O(n²).
The logic is straightforward: repeat a string of N stars for N rows.
