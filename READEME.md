# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository is a **topic-wise record of my Data Structures and Algorithms journey from scratch**.

I am solving problems by following **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**, focusing on building strong fundamentals and consistent problem-solving habits rather than collecting solutions.

Each problem includes:
- A clean and readable solution
- A written approach explaining the logic, complexity, and edge cases

This repository is meant to reflect **learning, clarity of thought, and progression over time**, and also serves as a personal revision resource.
